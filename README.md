# ListNoSuck Backend Node.js Server

- This app uses sqlite but you can power your apps with [a number of other storage options](https://glitch.com/storage)
- `sqlite.db` is created and put into the `.data` folder, a hidden directory whose contents aren’t copied when a project is remixed. You can see the contents of `.data` in the console under "Logs"
